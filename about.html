        <br>
        Meet Kgotsofalo. She's an entrepreneur, which is a person who starts a business. Kgotsofalo recently graduated from college with a degree in education and has developed an app that she believes will make her a small fortune. So, instead of working nine to five for a goverment job in Gauteng, she decides to start her own. She wants to challenge her self and work the way she wants to without answering to a boss. She's using a small inheritance to fund the start-up. As an entrepreneur, Kgotsofalo is not only starting a business, but is risking her personal wealth to establish it.Kgotsofalo is also trying to convince some friends from school to form an entrepreneurial team with her. An entrepreneurial team is a group of people that help spread out the risk of the new venture and also bring in different talents and skill sets to it. Kgotsofalo has a friend who majored in accounting and another who majored in marketing. She's hoping they may come along with him and bring their skills and some cash. If she can build the right team, she can create a synergy, where the group can achieve more together than they can apart.
